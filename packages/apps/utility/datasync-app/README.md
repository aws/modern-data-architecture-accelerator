# DataSync

AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage services.

## Deployed Resources and Compliance Details

**DataSync Agent Activation** - An agent activation step will register the agent with your AWS account.

* Agents read data from or write to your on-premises locations.
* Deploy multiple agents in different AZs/subnets to provide resiliency.
* DataSync agent must be deployed before the agent activation step can be done. Refer to [AWS DataSync agent requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/agent-requirements.html) for agent deployment and configuration.

**DataSync Location** - Locations are endpoints for tasks, such as an on-premises file system or cloud-based storage service.

* Currently, four types of storage are supported; NFS, SMB, S3, and object storage (cloud-based storage).
* Any location type which requires username/password credentials (SMB, Object Storage) must first have these credentials stored in a Secret, created and managed outside of CAEF

**DataSync Task** - Tasks are configurations for data transfer and synchronization between two locations.

## Prerequisite and Pre-deployment Tasks

### Prerequisite

* VPC Endpoint for DataSync service. The security group of the VPC Endpoint must allow control traffic from the DataSync agent on TCP port range 1024-1064. Refer to [Network requirements for VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/datasync-network.html#using-vpc-endpoint) for detail network requirement.
* A security group for DataSync tasks. When DataSync tasks are running, DataSync agents will transfer data to DataSync service via ENIs on TLS traffic port 443. The security group must allow TCP inbound traffic on port 443 from the agent hosts.
* For SMB and cloud-based storage location types, a secret in Secrets Manager is needed to store credentials. The secret must contain values in below format:
  * For SMB location: {user:< username >,password:< pwd >}
  * For cloud-based object storage: {"accessKey":< access_key >","secretKey":"< secret_key >"}

Note: If you want CAEF to handle the above security group requirement, two-stage deployment is required.

1. Put the information in the *connection:* section. Put the *agents:* configuration but do not specify *activationKey:* parameter in the agent configuration (Refer to the example for *agent1:* further below.)
2. Run the first pass CAEF deployment. CAEF will deploy the security group and required ingress rules.
3. Retrieve the agent activation key(s) and put in the *agents:* configuration, one for each agent.
4. Run the second pass CAEF deployment. CAEF will register the agent(s) and other DataSync resources.

### Pre-deployment Tasks

This process must be completed prior to DataSync deployment using CAEF.

![Pre-DeploymentTask](../../../constructs/L3/utility/datasync-l3-construct/docs/DataSync-pre-deployment.png)

1. Deploy DataSync agent in the platform of choice. You may deploy it on EC2 using DataSync AMI or another hypervisor platform. Refer to [Deploy your AWS DataSync agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/deploy-agents.html) for detail guideline.

2. Gather information that will be needed to retrieve the agent activation key in the next step:
   * The IP address of the DataSync Agent host (deployed in step 1)
   * The IP address of the VPC Endpoint for DataSync service

3. Retrieve agent activation key from a host or workstation with connectivity to the DataSync agent on port 80. The activation key can be retrieved using CLI or AWS Management Console.

   * Using CLI:
     `curl "http://<agent-ip-address>/?gatewayType=SYNC&activationRegion=<aws-region>&privateLinkEndpoint=<IP address from the same subnet/AZ of VPC endpoint>&endpointType=PRIVATE_LINK&no_redirect"`

     Refer to the step 4 of [Creating an AWS DataSync agent with the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-agent-cli.html) for more information.

   * Using AWS Management Console: follow the step 1 & 2 in [Activate your AWS DataSync agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/activate-agent.html).

4. Put the activation key retrieved in the previous step into the `activationKey` parameter of the DataSync module configuration file.
