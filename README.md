# Modern Data Architecture Accelerator (MDAA)

## MDAA Overview

The Modern Data Architecture Accelerator (MDAA) is designed to accelerate the implementation of a secure, compliant and fully capable Modern Data Architecture on AWS, allowing organizations of all sizes and sophsitication to quickly focus on driving business outcomes from their data while maintaining high assurance of security compliance. Specifically, organizations are enabled to rapidly solve data-driven problems using both traditional analytics, as well as using contemporary capabilities such as generative AI.

MDAA provides rapid deployment of all major elements of a Modern Data Architcture, such as Ingest, Persistence, Governance, DataOps, Consumption, Visual Analytics, Data Science, and AI/ML.
Additionally, MDAA has been designed to enable compliance with AWS Solutions, NIST 800-53 Rev5 (US), HIPAA, PCI-DSS CDK Nag Rulesets, as well as ITSG-33 (Canada) security control requirements. Terraform modules are compliant with standard Checkov security policies. This combination of integral compliance and broad, configuration-driven capability allows for rapid design and deployment of simple to complex data analytics environments--including Lake House and Data Mesh architectures--while minimizing security compliance risks.

## Target Usage

* Any organization looking to rapidly deploy a secure Modern Data Architecture in support of data-driven business/mission requirements, such as Analytics, Business Intelligence, AI/ML, and Generative AI
* Large organizations looking to design and deploy complex Modern Data Architectures such as Lake House or Data Mesh.
* Small to Medium organizations looking for code-free, configuration-driven deployment of a Data Analytics platform.
* Builder organizations who are building custom, code-driven data analytics architectures through use of reusable compliant constructs across multiple languages.
* Any organization with elevated compliance/regulatory requirements.

***

## Getting Started

Getting started with MDAA requires the following steps:

1. [Architecture and Design](ARCHITECTURES.md) - A physical platform architecture should be defined either from scratch, or derived from an AWS/MDAA reference design.
2. [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) - One or more MDAA configuration files are authored, along with individual configuration files for each MDAA module.
3. [(Optional) Customization](CUSTOMIZATION.md) - Optionally, resources and stacks can be customized through code-based escape hatches before deployment.
4. [Predeployment Preparation](PREDEPLOYMENT.md) - In this step, the MDAA NPM packages are built and published to a private NPM repo.
5. [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) - Each MDAA configuration file is either manually or automatically deployed (via CD/CD).

### Sample Architectures

Alternatively, you can jump directly into a set of sample architectures and configurations. Note that these sample configurations can be used as a starting point for much more sophisticated architectures.

* [Basic DataLake with Glue](sample_configs/basic_datalake/README.md) - A basic S3 Data Lake with Glue database and crawler
* [Basic Terraform DataLake](sample_configs/basic_terraform_datalake/README.md) - A basic S3 Data Lake built with the MDAA Terraform module
* [Fine-grained Access Control DataLake](sample_configs/lakeformation_datalake/README.md) - An S3 Data Lake with fine-grained access control using LakeFormation
* [Data Warehouse](sample_configs/basic_datawarehouse/README.md) - A standalone Redshift Data Warehouse
* [Lakehouse](sample_configs/lakehouse/README.md) - A full LakeHouse implementation, with Data Lake, Data Ops Layers (using NYC taxi data), and a Redshift data warehouse
* [Data Science Platform](sample_configs/basic_datascience_platform/README.md) - A standalone SageMaker Studio Data Science Platform
* [GenAI Platform](sample_configs/basic_gaia/README.md) - A standalone GAIA GenAI Platform

### Sample DataOps Blueprints

Additionally, once your Modern Data Architecture is deployed, you can use these sample Data Operations blueprints, including MDAA configs and DataOps code, to start solving your data-driven problems.

* [Basic Crawler](sample_blueprints/basic_dataops_crawler/README.md) - A basic crawler blueprint
* [Event-Driven CSV to Parquet Lambda](sample_blueprints/lambda_csv_parquet/README.md) - A blueprint for transforming small-medium CSV files into Parquet as they are uploaded into a datalake.
* [Schedule-Driven CSV to Parquet Glue](sample_blueprints/glue_csv_parquet/README.md) - A blueprint for transforming larger CSV files into Parquet on a scheduled basis using Glue ETL.

## Logical Design

MDAA is designed as a set of logical architectural layers, each constituted by a set of functional 'modules'. Each module configures and deploys a set of resources which constitute the data analytics environment. Modules may have logical dependencies on eachother, and may also leverage non-MDAA resources deployed within the environment, such as those deployed via Landing Zone Accelerator.

While MDAA can be used to implement a comprehensive, end to end data analytics platform, it ***does not*** result in a closed system. MDAA may be freely integrated with non-MDAA deployed platform elements and analytics capabilites. Any individual layer or module of MDAA can be replaced by a non-MDAA component, and the remaining layers/modules will continue to function (assuming basic functional parity with the replaced MDAA module/layer).

MDAA is conceptually, architecturally, and technically similar in nature to the Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA), providing similar functionality for analytics platform configuration and deployment as LZA does for general cloud platform configuration and deployment. The logical layers of MDAA are specifically designed to be deployed on top of a general purpose, secure cloud platform such as that deployed by LZA.

## Design Principles

### Security and Compliance

See [MDAA Security](SECURITY.md)

### Governance

* Leverage Infrastructure as Code (CDK/CloudFormation, Terraform)--as the single agent of deployment and change within the target AWS accounts
* Optional governed, secure self-service deployments via Service Catalog
* Consistent but customizable naming convention across all deployed resources
* Consistent tagging of all generated resources

### Accessibility, Flexibility and Extensibility

* Flexible, YAML configuration-driven deployments (CDK Apps) with implicit application of security controls in code
* Ability to orchestrate architectures with both Terraform and CDK-based modules
* Optional publishing of Service Catalog products for end-user self-service of compliant infrastructure
* Reusable CDK L2 and L3 Constructs, and Terraform Modules for consistent application of security controls across modules
* Extensibility through multi-language support using the same approach as CDK itself (via JSII)
  * TypeScript/Node.js
  * Python 3.x
  * Java
  * .Net

## MDAA Components

MDAA is implemented as a set of compliant modules which can be deployed via a unified Deployment/Orchestration layer. 

* **MDAA CDK Modules** - A set of configuration-driven CDK Apps, which leverage the MDAA CDK Constructs in order to define and deploy compliant data analytics environment components as CloudFormation stacks. These apps can be executed directly and independantly using CDK cli, or composed and orchestrated via the MDAA CLI.

* **MDAA Terraform Modules (Preview)** - A set of standardized Terraform modules which adhere to security control requirements. These apps can be executed directly and independantly using Terraform cli, or composed and orchestrated via the MDAA CLI. Note that Terraform integration is currently in preview, and not all MDAA functionality is available.

* **MDAA CDK L2 and L3 Constructs** - A set of reusable CDK constructs which are leveraged by the rest of the MDAA codebase, but can also be reused to build additional compliant CDK constructs, stacks, or apps. These constructs are each designed for compliance with AWS Solutions, HIPAA, PCI-DSS and NIST 800-53 R5 CDK Nag rulesets. Similar to the CDK codebase MDAA is built on, MDAA constructs are available with binding for multiple langauges, currently including TypeScript/Node.js and Python 3.

* **MDAA CLI (Deployement/Orchestration) App** - A configuration driven CLI application which allows for composition and orchestration of multiple MDAA Modules (CDK and Terraform) in order to deploy a compliant end to end data analytics environment. Also ensures that each MDAA Module is deployed with the specified configuration into the specified accounts while also accounting for dependencies between modules.
